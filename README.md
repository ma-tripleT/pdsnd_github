### Bikeshare statistics project

bikeshare for the [nanodegree 104](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

### Description

This project looks at statistics from incomplete data of a bikeshare program in Chicago, NYC & Washington DC. The user interface is a terminal prompt all contained in `bikeshare_2.py`.

To run this project from the terminal: 

```python
python bikeshare_2.py
```

and you will be prompted three times for:

1. A city - either "Chicago", "New York City" or "Washington"
2. A month - either the Gregorian month or "all"
3. Day of the week - any of the days or "all"

The input is case insensitive, so you can type "WaSHinGTon" or any combination of upper/lowercase. If you enter a word that is not on the accepted list, you'll be prompted to re-enter until a valid input is provided. 

### Files used

You will need the following files:

1. `bikeshare.py` is the script to run
2. 3x data files
    1. washington.csv
    2. new_york_city.csv
    3. chiacgo.csv


### Credits

Thanks to the official python documentation and geeksforgeeks.org for inspiration.
